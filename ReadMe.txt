### PVRTextureLoader ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This application illustrates how to load a PVR texture file using the included PVRTexture class and then display it using OpenGL ES.

The sample image, encoded as an xcode project build phase, is rendered on a rotatable and scalable quad. Controls are provided for experimenting with various texture compression and filter settings.

Further details are given as comments in the code.

===========================================================================
BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

Mac OS X 10.5.3, Xcode 3.1, iPhone OS 2.2

===========================================================================
RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS:

Mac OS X 10.5.3, iPhone OS 2.0

PACKAGING LIST:

Classes/PVRTexture.h
Classes/PVRTexture.m
The PVRTexture class is responsible for loading the pvr files generated by texturetool. The class handles loading mipmapped and non-mipmapped pvr files.
The method calls to create a PVRTexture object will also generate a GL texture name and upload as many texture levels as are present.

Classes/EAGLView.h
Classes/EAGLView.m
The OpenGL ES code that is responsible for displaying the encoded pvr data.

Brick_mipmap_4.pvr
Brick_mipmap_2.pvr
Brick_4.pvr
Brick_2.pvr
These are the pvr files generated from the Brick.png image by the "Encode Images" build phase.
